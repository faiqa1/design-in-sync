          Hi, I'm Faiqa, a Web Developer with almost a year of experience in building web applications. 
          I graduated from LCWU and have skills beyond beginner but not yet at an advanced level. 
          Right now, I'm improving my knowledge of backend development and problem-solving while working on a web project. 
          I enjoy creating innovative solutions and contributing to useful projects. 
          Thank you for your time and consideration.
